# Github testing
First edit to README file!  
Second edit, using Github!  
Conflict settled, both parties happy :)  

From completing this assignment, I learned why it's called a "pull request" - you're requesting that the main branch pulls your changes into the remote repository.  
I also gained a needed refresher on commiting, pushing, and pulling. Additionally, I learned that it's not good to add large files that change  
to your git repository, as it will create a copy of that file each time you commit changes, which will use up a lot of space.

Testing remote and local repos are still synced after name change.
