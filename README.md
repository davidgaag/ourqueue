# Github testing
First edit to README file!  
Second edit, using Github!  
Conflict settled, both parties happy :)  

From completing this assignment, I learned why it's called a "pull request" - you're requesting that the main branch pulls your changes into the remote repository.  
I also gained a needed refresher on commiting, pushing, and pulling. Additionally, I learned that it's not good to add large files that change  
to your git repository, as it will create a copy of that file each time you commit changes, which will use up a lot of space.

Testing remote and local repos are still synced after name change.

# Interesting Linux Commands
`traceroute google.com` - See the network path your computer connected through reach the target website  
`dig google.com` - Get the IP address for a domain  
`whois google.com` - Get information about a domain name  

# HTML
`<!DOCTYPE html>` - required at top of document, as well as `<html>` tag to begin HTML file  
`<input>` - multiple input options, depending on `type` attribute  
`<button>`
`<label>` - Label for inputs, use attribute `for` to specify `id` of the intended object  
`<table>`, with `<tr>` rows, `<td>` table data  
`class` attribute - use to group content, regardless of location within HTML document  
`id` attribute - assign unique ID to element
## Tag Structure
`<html>` - root  
`<head>` - contains metadata, such those affecting title of webpage, favicon, viewport  
`<body>`, contains:
- `<header>` - header
- `<main>` - main content
- `<footer>` - footer

# CSS
- CSS info goes in `<head>` tag, either link or using `<style>` tag  
- Can also put inline, e.g. `<p style="color:green">CSS</p>`  

## Rule Selectors
- element type selectors  
- combinators
    - descendant: `body section` 
    - child (direct children): `section > p`
    - general sibling: `p ~ div`
    - adjacent sibling: `p + div`  
- class selectors - `.summary`, 
    - can combine element name and class selectors: `p.summary`
- ID selectors - `#physics`  
- attribute selectors 
    - any element with given attribute: `a[href]`
    - with attribute and required value: `a[href="./fish.png"]`
    - wildcard selector (*) - when attribute value contains "https://": `p[href*="https://"]`
- pseudo selectors
    - positional relationships
    - mouse interactions
    - hyperlink visitation status
    - attributes

## Declarations
The actual CSS attributes assigned to elements of a webpage to change their appearance. See [here](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/css/declarations/declarations.md) for most commonly used declarations.  

## Units
Absolute (px, in) and realtive (em, ...). See link above for more details.  

## Color
- keyword
- RGB hex, optional alpha `#00FFAA22`
- RGB function `rbg(50%, 255, 128, 0.5)`
- HSL `hsl(180, 30%, 90%, 0.5)`  

## Responsive CSS
- Media queries: `@media (condition) { conditional formatting }` - e.g. `(orientation: portrait)`
### Flex
`display: flex;`
- children: add `flex:` CSS attribute
    - `flex: 0 80px` - 0 means it won't grow, starting height of 80px
    - `flex: 1` - one fractional unit of growth. If there are 3 children with `flex: 1`, each child will get 1/3 the space. 
### Grid
- `display: grid;` - Grid display
```
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  grid-auto-rows: 300px;
  grid-gap: 1em;
}
```
- `grid-template-columns` - specifies grid layout
    - "repeatedly define each column to auto-fill the parent element's width with children that are resized to a minimum of 300 pixels and a maximum of one equal fractional unit (1fr) of the grid width. A fractional unit is dynamically computed by splitting up the parent element's width into equal parts for each of the children."
- 300px high, 1em gap between grid items
